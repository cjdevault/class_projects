# class_projects
All files committed were written in courses under the University of Arizona Computer Science Department. 
Two classes, namely: CSC 120, Intro to Programming II (python) and CSC 210, Software Development (Java). 
These classes focus on general programming principles and emphasize data structure implementations while analyzing various file types. 
CSC 210 utilized eclipse, an industry-level IDE to run and test any code. Students had to implement their own test cases as well.
